# geopins - https://geopins.den4ik777.now.sh/
A realtime, full-stack React app with a GraphQL Server (Apollo Server 2) on the backend, a cloud MongoDB database (Mongo Atlas) with React Hooks to manage our state (replacing Redux!), with Social Authentication (Google OAuth2), realtime data with GraphQL Subscriptions, image uploads with Cloudinary and much more.

GeoPins is a live geolocation app where users can 'pin' different locations on the map and share their own content with other users in realtime--to share pictures, reviews of the location and area, interact with other users by adding comments to their pins, and manage the pins they've created.
